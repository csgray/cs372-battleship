Welcome to our project and to my project diary. This is where I will keep track of fun things I did after I commit new things.
Today is mainly a day about brainstorming so nothing too exciting to commit but stay tuned!
-Cam 2/8/18

Today me and Duane did about 2.5 hours of Python and webdev learning. We added a folder called python-learning that has the files.
Also added a url to the gitter chat which is a snake-game written all in python using asyncio. We did tutorials for python and flask today.
-2/13/18

Pair programmed with corey, learned about phaser.io and did tutorials. Got basic local webservers up and running using phaser.io
in conjunction with http-server and node.js
-2/15/18

Duane, Corey and I got together. Got a basic board, assets and mouse events handled. This was our most prductive day thus far.
-2/18/18

Added the ability to rotate our ships and merged that branch back into master. Currently rotates kind of weird.
-2/19/18

Made the ships into a ship group, collision/overlap detection works and our game is now state-based. We still need to figure
out how to make rotation bounding work properly.
-2/25/18

Fixed some PNGs for Duane. This was a fun project. I think my final thoughts on the matter and the project are: 

Pair programming (triplet programming) is a really powerful and useful tool. As is agile development. Often at work I 
will sit down and think about what classes I need to make, make a prototype and it feels like when I'm finally going it's
a few days later and even then I will find I don't need half the crap I put in there. If we follow the agile mantra we will 
test often and develop quickly with faster results. I will incorporate some of the mantras in my day to day coding life 
most definitely.
